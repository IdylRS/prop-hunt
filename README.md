# Prop Hunt

Were you one of the many people who played prop hunt on Garry's Mod back in the day?  Do you miss the shenanigans of getting together with your friends and disguising yourself  as a bowl of soup?  Then this is the plugin for you.

## What is it?

Prop Hunt allows you to disguise yourself as an in game model while your friends  do their best to try and track you down.

## How does it work?

There are two menus to utilize, one for the Seeker and one for the Hider.

## Config menu (Seeker menu)

Gather your friends and type their usernames  (comma separated)  in the Players field in the plugin settings. This will allow you to see the disguises of each respective user.

Seekers are encouraged to turn on each setting in this menu.

*Hide Minimap Dots:* Toggle whether minimap dots are hidden. **(Recommended for seekers)**
*Deprioritize Menu Clicks:* Forces 'Walk Here' to the top of every menu to better hide props. **(Recommended for seekers)**
*Limit Right Clicks:* Limit the number of right clicks a seeker can do. (Guesses they may take)
*Maximum Right Clicks:* The number of guesses a seeker can make.

## Hider Menu (Side Panel)

You will find the Prop Hunt panel on the side of your RuneLite client, this is the main menu used by hiders. 

*NOTE:* Hiders are encouraged to also add the player names in the config menu, but otherwise they only need to utilize this menu.

**MODEL PANEL**
In this panel, you have two options:

			 - *Enter Model ID:* You may explicitly input your desired model ID, this will automatically apply if Hide Mode is 		enabled.
    
			 - *Randomizer:* Specifying a range of model IDS, utilizing the Min ID and Max ID fields, you may randomize your model ID by clicking the "Randomize Model" button. This will automatically apply if Hide Mode is enabled.

**ORIENTATION PANEL**
Use this panel to rotate your model.

**HIDE MODE**
Ensure this button is active if you are a hider, this will swap your model for the chosen ID.

## How do I win?

That's really for you to decide.  This plugin is left open,  so you can create your own win conditions  or rules around the idea of hiding as a game object!
